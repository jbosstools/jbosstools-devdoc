Revised swimlanes, as implemented for 3.2.x, 3.3.x, 4.0.x jobs

Last updated 2012/10/22

------------------------

New in 4.0 (Core):

New component hierarchy/organization (after migration to git):

https://issues.jboss.org/secure/attachment/12357087/12357087_max_suggestio.png

* migration to git: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-12475

* deltacloud [removed]

* runtime no longer depends on as, seam

New in 4.0 (SOA Tooling):

* Flow/jbpm4/jpdl4 removed. See https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-12631

After migration, job flows will be:

1. CME {central/maven/examples} -> JavaEE {seam, jsf, cdi, struts} -> jst, vpe, xulrunner, Server, Base 
2. BIRT -> Hibernate, Server, gwt, forge, freemarker  -> Base
3. webservices (ws), openshift -> Server {jmx, as, archives}  -> Base {common, runtime, tests, usage}
	(both ws and openshift depend on Server, which depends on Base)
	(Server is composed of as depending on archives and on jmx)
	(Base is composed of common, runtime, tests, and usage)
