The folder `secrets` contains usernames and password for various services used by JBoss Tools.
Encrypted and managed with https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox[blackbox] tool for easy use of GPG based encryption.

To edit/view install `blackbox` and use `blackbox_edit <filename>` to see the decrypted content.

If you cannot edit/view the content you need someone with admin access to add you to the repo.
