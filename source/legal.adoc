= Legal issues

When dealing with open source code there are two primary areas of concern when it comes to possible legal issues: <<Copyright,copyright>> and <<Trademark,trademark>>.

Copyright is related in context of contributions and use of 3rd party
dependencies, where Trademark are mainly about use of logos, icons,
etc. (including JBoss and Red Hat own logos)

This document tries to outline the general approaches to handle issues.

In any doubt contact post on jbosstools-dev@lists.jboss.org or if preferred ping JBoss Tools lead (manderse@redhat.com) directly. 

== Copyright

All source code around JBoss Tools are Open Source and we accept contributions from anyone willing to do so under the license used for the 
the relevant project.

We prefer to use Eclipse Public License since it allows for the easiest interaction and codesharing with other Eclipse IDE projects.

The table below tries to capture list of licenses used or previously encountered and how it can be used.

WARNING: This is a work in progress. If any questions/concerns contact jbosstools-dev@lists.jboss.org for clarification from project leads.

.License table
|===
|License | In Code | As dependency | Distribution | Comments

| EPL
| Yes
| Yes
| Yes
|

| GPL
| No
| No
| Yes
| GPL is not possible to use in Eclipse plugins project without severely limiting how it can be distributed.
  See http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLAndPlugins[Gnu FAQ]

| GPL + classpath exception
| Limited
| Yes
| ?
| Notable example here are OpenJDK libraries. Fine as dependency, but problematic to have in our source since
  we would need ot be extra careful about how and what gets linked to it.
  
| ASL
| Limited
| Yes
| Yes
| Limited for source since it is preferred this is at least dual licensed under EPL

| SAP library license
| No
| Limited
| No
| For integration with SAP we build against a closed library with limits of distribution. Requires custom handling and
  we *cannot* ship the binaries. It is *highly* discouraged to use unless absolutely no other way to integrate.

== Trademark

Trademark in context of JBoss Tools mainly evolve around using projects logos to identify parts of the tooling supports it.
For example, using a JBoss logo for our JBoss server adapter and more.

In general any logo or image that resembles some trademark needs to be explicitly cleared for usage unless their license are
crystal clear about it being okey to use.
