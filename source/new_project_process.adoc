= Adding a new module/component/project to github

This document outlines how to create a new repository for inclusion in JBoss Tools or JBDS. 

== Consensus on Requirements

Submit your proposal to mailto:jbosstools-dev@lists.jboss.org[jbosstools-dev@lists.jboss.org] for review, explaining why your proposed project should stand alone, rather than being part of an existing JBoss Tools project. 

If there is some sensitive content which cannot be publically discussed / announced, please send a private email directly to mailto:max.andersen@redhat.com[max.andersen@redhat.com].


== Create your own repository

Your first step is to create your own repository on github to hold your new component. Please see link:https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/[GitHub's Documentation] for more information. 

== Layout

The layout for repositories included in JBossTools can vary depending on whether your repository is intended to hold only one component, like the link:https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-openshift/[jbosstools-openshift] repository, or if it will hold multiple different components, such as how link:https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-base/[jbosstools-base] includes foundation, common, runtime, stacks, and usage. 

=== Simple project layout

A repository holding only one component should have the following folder structure and files:

```
pom.xml   - Your root pom for your component
README.md - A document outlining how users can get involved, the purpose of the project, etc
plugins   - A folder containing a folder for each plugin, and a pom.xml
tests     - A folder containing a folder for each unit test plugin, and a pom.xml
itests    - An optional folder containing a folder for each integration test plugin, and a pom.xml
features  - A folder containing a folder for each feature, and a pom.xml. 
site      - A folder containing a category.xml nad a pom.xml for generating update sites
```

=== Complex project layout

A repository holding several components should have the following folder structure and files:

```
pom.xml        - Your root pom for your repository
README.md      - A document outlining how users can get involved, the purpose of the repository, etc
componentName1 - A containing folder for your first component
  componentName1/pom.xml
  componentName1/plugins
  componentName1/tests
  componentName1/itests
  componentName1/features
componentName2 - A containing folder for your first component
  componentName2/pom.xml
  componentName2/plugins
  componentName2/tests
  componentName2/itests
  componentName2/features
site      - A folder containing a category.xml nad a pom.xml for generating update sites
```

= Next steps

Once you have a repository set up, you'll want to perform one of the following actions:

** link:how_to_add_a_test_plugin_or_feature.adoc[Adding a new unit or integration test and test feature]
** link:../building/target_platforms/target_platforms_updates.adoc[Requesting Target Platform Updates]
** TODO Adding an update site / category.xml
