= Using PDE Source Lookup

This document explains how to install, then use the PDE Source Lookup plugin to automatically fetch missing source bundles from enabled p2 repositories, when opening a bundle jar (similar to m2e).

It's also possible to fetch all sources from the `Plug-in Dependencies` classpath container. Simply right-click and select `Download Bundle Sources`.

Sources are cached to `~/.eclipse/org.jboss.tools.pde.sourcelookup.core/sources`. That folder can be changed in `Preferences` > `Plug-in Development` > `Source Lookup`.

[NOTE]
====
Because the `Plug-in Dependencies` classpath container doesn't keep new attached sources on workspace restart (link:https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=492204[EBZ 492204]), the PDE Source Lookup plugin automatically reattaches thoses sources upon restart.
This behavior can be disabled in `Preferences` > `Plug-in Development` > `Source Lookup`.
