= Publishing features to JBoss Tools, Red Hat CodeReady Studio, JBoss Central, Early Access, and Eclipse Marketplace

Once your features are ready for consumption by other projects, you can have them aggregated into a downstream project.

== JBoss Tools

Submit a pull request against the appropriate branch of the https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-build-sites/tree/master/aggregate[jbosstools-build-sites] to get your feature(s) added into 1 or more of these category.xml files:

* https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-build-sites/tree/master/aggregate/site/category.xml[aggregate/site/category.xml] - for all features
* https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-build-sites/tree/master/aggregate/coretests-site/category.xml[aggregate/coretests-site/category.xml] - for test features

== Red Hat CodeReady Studio

First, ensure your feature(s) are included in JBoss Tools, as above.

Then, submit a pull request here: https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/[jbdevstudio-product]

* https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/blob/master/site/category.xml[site/category.xml] - for all features
* https://github.com/jbdevstudio/jbdevstudio-product/blob/master/features/com.jboss.devstudio.core.rpm.feature/feature.xml[features/com.jboss.devstudio.core.rpm.feature/feature.xml] - for features that should be installed automatically when installing JBoss Developer Studio via the installer or Eclipse Marketplace

== JBoss Central

To get a feature (or collection of features) added to JBoss Central, you need to submit a pull request against https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-discovery[jbosstools-discovery].

First, update the target platform to include the new feature(s):

* https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-discovery/blob/master/jbtcentraltarget/multiple/jbtcentral-multiple.target[jbtcentraltarget/multiple/jbtcentral-multiple.target]

Then, add a new connector to the discovery plugin, to expose those feature(s) via the appropriate categor(ies):

* https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-discovery/blob/master/jbosstools/org.jboss.tools.central.discovery/plugin.xml[jbosstools/org.jboss.tools.central.discovery/plugin.xml]
* https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-discovery/blob/master/devstudio/com.jboss.devstudio.central.discovery/plugin.xml[devstudio/com.jboss.devstudio.central.discovery/plugin.xml]

== Early Access

To get a feature (or collection of features) added to the Early Access site, you need to submit a pull request against https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-discovery[jbosstools-discovery].

First, update the target platform to include the new feature(s):

* https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-discovery/blob/master/jbtearlyaccesstarget/multiple/jbtearlyaccess-multiple.target[jbtearlyaccesstarget/multiple/jbtearlyaccess-multiple.target]

Then, add a new connector to the discovery plugin, to expose those feature(s) via the appropriate categor(ies):

* https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-discovery/blob/master/jbosstools/org.jboss.tools.central.discovery.earlyaccess/plugin.xml[jbosstools/org.jboss.tools.central.discovery.earlyaccess/plugin.xml]
* https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-discovery/blob/master/devstudio/com.jboss.devstudio.central.discovery.earlyaccess/plugin.xml[devstudio/com.jboss.devstudio.central.discovery.earlyaccess/plugin.xml]

== Eclipse Marketplace

To get added to the Eclipse Marketplace, open a https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE[JIRA] listing the feature(s) to be included in the appropriate JBoss Tools Marketplace connector. These features should already be included in the JBoss Tools update site, above.
