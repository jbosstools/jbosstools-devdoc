= Process for updates to target platforms

Target platforms should not grow or change unexpectedly. 

Below is the process to follow for sanely changing the target platform to empower developers and keep churn to a minimum.

Goals:

. Avoid unnecessary churn (failed builds)
. Avoid adding unnecessary or incomplete dependencies
. Document why and when changes occur

Process:

. <<create-jira-outlining-the-request,Create JIRA outlining the request>>
. <<create-pull-request,Create pull-request with changes>>
. <<validate-local-changes,Validate local changes>>
. <<test-local-target-platform-use,Test local target platform use>>
. <<produce-a-p2diff-report,Produce a p2diff report>> to include in JIRA and/or email
. <<send-mail-for-feedback,Send email>> to jbosstools-dev@lists.jboss.org requesting feedback. State expected feedback window (usually 1 week).
. <<await-feedback,Await feedback>> from build, affected team leads and project lead(s). For urgent changes, 1 project lead is OK.
. Apply the pull-request

== Create JIRA outlining the request

Use https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JBIDE to open the issue.

*Type of bug*:

* _Feature Request_ if this change is introducing or removing a new feature/set of plugins

* _Bug_ if this is just to fix/update existing plugins

*Component*: _target-platform_ + releated components if applicable (i.e. _gwt_)

*Assignee*: (default)

*Fix version*: Set it to the corresponding JBoss Tools release

*Description*:

Template (copy into JIRA):

  Reason: 
  
  License and owner: 
  
  Original repo: http://third-party-vendor.com/path/to/updates-site/

  JBoss mirror: http://downloads.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/requirements/<projectName>

  Sources:

  Affected projects:

  Include in JBDS: Yes|No

  Type of dependency: testing|central-only|distribution

  List of bundles added/removed:

  If applicable:

    non-p2 repository:
  
    non-p2 ids:

----

Provide enough detail to explain why the change is needed, and what is required to verify. If you do not know the answer use "Unknown"; if not applicable, use "N/A".

* _Reason_: Why is the request needed, typical reasons are: "Required by new feature described in JBIDE-xyz", "Eclipse releasetrain update from Kepler M5 to M6" or "Removal because it conflicts with JBTIS and give bug describe at JBIDE-xyz"

* _License and owner_: Which license are these features available under and who are the maintainer? i.e. EPL, Google.

* _Original repo_: which repository are the plugins/features from? eg., http://dl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/4.2

* _JBoss mirror_: mirror URL to use, eg. http://downloads.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/requirements/gwt/3.1.0.v201208080121-rel-r42/

* _Sources_: Are source bundles included in the mirror, or are sources available elsewhere? Use "included" or explain.

* _Affected projects_: Which projects are this known to affect, both inside and outside JBoss Tools core.

* _Include in JBDS_: Incubating (unstable) features should only be included in JBoss Tools.

* _Type of dependency_: is this just for testing (incl. in TP, but not in distribution), central-only (incl. in Central ONLY, not in the JBoss Tools or JBDS target platform), distribution (incl. in installer & update sites)

* _List of bundles added/removed_: https://github.com/nickboldt/p2diff[p2diff] report or pull-request preferred; if not available, please list features/plugins in alpha-sorted order

If your requirement is not available in an update site (p2 repository), eg. only available as maven artifact, please include more info:

* _non-p2 repository_: the exact repository URL (eg., Maven central or jboss repository) where the artifact exists

* _non-p2 ids_: list the exact ids, eg., for Maven state GAV (Group, Artifact, Version)

Non-p2 artifacts will be added to https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-locus[JBoss Tools Locus] as p2 artifacts, so they can be included in the target platform.

== Create pull request

Following instructions cover the minimal edits needed for a review (a final Pull request needs updates to both jbosstools and devstudio target platform as needed)

 $ git clone git@github.com:jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms.git
 $ cd jbosstools-target-platforms
 $ git checkout <relevant version.x>
 
Edit `jbosstools/multiple/jbosstools-multiple-target`. You may update an existing location or add a new one:

[source,xml]
----
    <location includeAllPlatforms="false" includeMode="slicer" type="InstallableUnit" includeSource="true">
      <repository location="http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/requirements/atlassian/3.2.2.v20130909/"/>
      <unit id="com.atlassian.connector.eclipse.jira.feature.group" version="3.2.2.v20130909"/>
      <unit id="com.thoughtworks.xstream" version="1.3.0.v20100826-1640"/>
      <unit id="org.joda.time" version="1.6.0.v20081202-0100"/>
    </location>
----

If your change affects JBDS too, edit `jbdevstudio/multiple/jbdevstudio-multiple-target` as well.

[NOTE]
If you do not have a mirrored download.jboss.org location use the vendor's URL, so that the .target file can be easily tested.


== Validate local changes

Now build and validate the target platform. 

The latest instructions can be found in the https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms/blob/master/README.md#updating-versions-of-ius-in-target-files[README]

== Test local target platform use

Once this is built you can test it in your component build by running:

 $ mvn verify -Dtpc.targetKind=multiple -Dtpc.version=4.40.0.Beta2-SNAPSHOT

where the `tpc.version` is the version listed in the `pom.xml` file of the target platform and 'tpc.targetKind' is set to 'multiple' since the default ('unified') will not work when the target platform is not yet built and published publically.

If everything builds OK, can be installed (see validation steps in https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms/blob/master/README.md#updating-versions-of-ius-in-target-files[README]), and you can use the new functionallity needed by the change, open a pull request for your update.

== Produce a p2diff report

Optionally, you can create a https://github.com/nickboldt/p2diff[p2diff] report to clarify what IUs will change if your PR is applied. For example:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/nickboldt/p2diff.git
pushd p2diff/org.eclipse.equinox.p2.example.p2diff.releng/ && mvn install && popd

cd linux/gtk/x86_64 # or your preferred platform

Subject:

Proposed change to JBT ${TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION} target platform:

Body:

Here is a proposal for a change to the JBoss Tools ${TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION} target platform: 

https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms/pull/FIXME

It consists in the following changes:

* JBIDE-FIXME (Description of change goes here)

--

p2diff report:



--

Please review the above PR(s), as it will be applied in the next *${DEADLINE}*.

You can use the following to build & test the TP locally against your component(s).

Build target-platform:

  $ cd jbosstools-target-platforms
  $ git fetch ${GITHUB_USER} ${TOPIC_BRANCH}
  $ git checkout FETCH_HEAD
  $ cd jbosstools/multiple
  $ mvn clean install -P \!multiple2repo
  
Try with just built target-platform:

  $ cd /path/to/your/component
  $ mvn clean verify -Dtpc.version=${TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION} -Pmultiple.target

--

If you want to perform a scripted install of the entire target platform 
into your local Eclipse or JBDS instance, you can now do so with this 
script:

https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-build-ci/blob/master/util/installFromTarget.sh

Usage is documented in the above script, and in this README:

https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms/tree/master#updating-versions-of-ius-in-target-files

== Await feedback

Generally, developers should have 7 days to review a proposed change. 

However, for more urgent changes (such as to fix a broken contribution from a previous PR or to remove something on which no projects still depend), *1 or 2 days* may be sufficient. 

Be sure to state the deadline in the email so devs & project leads know the urgency.
