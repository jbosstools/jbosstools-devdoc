Building JBoss Tools 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A simplified version of this document exists for JBoss Tools 4.1:

https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-devdoc/blob/master/building/faq.md[JBoss Tools 4.1 Build FAQ]


Note that this article only discusses building from master (trunk). To work with
another branch, see http://learn.github.com/p/branching.html[Learn.GitHub - Branching and
Merging].

Documentation].


Environment Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Prerequisistes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Java 1.6 SDK
2.  Maven 3.0.3
3.  About 6 GB of free disk space if you want to run all integration
tests for (JBoss AS, Seam and Web Services Tools) - *requires VPN
access*
4.  Git client


Maven and Java
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure your maven 3 is available by default and Java 1.6 is used.


 mvn -version

should print out something like
    Apache Maven 3.0.5 (r01de14724cdef164cd33c7c8c2fe155faf9602da; 2013-02-19 08:51:28-0500)
    Maven home: /opt/maven3
    Java version: 1.7.0_17, vendor: Oracle Corporation
    Java home: /opt/jdk1.7.0_17/jre
    Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
    OS name: "linux", version: "3.8.3-203.fc18.x86_64", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"

Maven settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See https://community.jboss.org/wiki/MavenGettingStarted-Developers[Maven Getting Started - Developers] to
add a reference to the JBoss Repositories into your settings.xml. You'll also
probably need access to the SNAPSHOT repository. So here is what you
should see in your ~/.m2/settings.xml

Maven & Java Memory Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure the amount of memory used by Maven, you can define MVN_OPTS
as follows, either in the mvn / mvn.bat script you use to run Maven, or
set as global environment variables. Here's how to do so for
http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=262465[Fedora],
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables[Ubuntu],
http://forums.techarena.in/windows-xp-support/1152405.htm[Windows],
http://www.digitaledgesw.com/node/31[OSX].

----
set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m
----


Verify or Install?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mvn verify will perform all build and test steps, but it won't install
the bundles in your local repository. mvn install does install in you
local repository. When an eclipse-plugin is installed in your repo, it
is always used as default when resolving dependency. It is not possible
to roll-back a local installation of a bundle, so in most cases, mvn
verify is to be prefered to mvn install. However, if you want to build
stuff sequentially through several maven invocations, and you want to
resolve against just-built stuff, you'll need to use mvn install.

In this page, we'll encourage people to use *mvn verify* as much as
possible to ensure *isolation*; but you can mvn install the same way if
your use-case requires it.

_*What if I've already built something locally, but I want to build
against the server version instead of my local repo?*_

There are
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform#Locally_built_artifacts[two
approaches] that work here:

a) override temporarily when building, using
`-Dtycho.localArtifacts=ignore`

b) delete `~/.m2/repository/.meta/p2-local-metadata.properties`


About Target Platform and related profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The target platform (TP) lists all dependencies (coming from Eclipse.or
and other 3rd-party update sites) that are used by JBoss Tools. This
target platform is materialized as an Eclipse p2 repository (formerly
update-site) that is used during build to resolve dependencies. Target
Platform is managed by JBoss Tools people, and only dependencies from
this TP are allowed to be used in code.

If you need a new dependency in the TP, feel free to
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10020&summary=Please%20add%20....%20to%20JBT%20/%20JBDS%20Target%20Platforms&components=12315342&issuetype=13&Create=Create[open
a ticket to request it].

Here are several ways to build locally using this target platform. It's
up to you to choose the one that match your needs:


Using published Target Platform definition (Recommended, Default)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

unified.target refers to the dependency as published in the Target
Platform repository.

* Pros:
** Need only invoke Maven
** Always up-to-date

* Cons: 
** Evaluation is slower than when using a local target platform

Consume it by adding `-Punified.target`to your Maven command line


Or, get a local copy of the Target Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Pros:
** Faster to use than a remote one

* Cons: 
** Must re-fetch every time remote SNAPSHOT https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-build/tree/master/target-platforms[target platforms] are updated, or a new one is released
 
Get it
++++++

Download TP as a zip and install it by yourself

You can either download the TP as a zip and unpack it into some folder
on your disk. Just remember to update your
link:#maven-settings[~/.m2/settings.xml] file to point at the location where you
unpacked it.

You can get it with a browser or a command line tool such as `wget` or `curl` at the following url:

* current minimum Juno TP: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/targetplatforms/jbosstoolstarget/4.20.6.Final-SNAPSHOT/jbosstoolstarget-4.20.6.Final-SNAPSHOT.zip[jbosstoolstarget-4.20.6.Final-SNAPSHOT.zip]

* current maximum Juno TP: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/targetplatforms/jbosstoolstarget/4.22.2.Final-SNAPSHOT/jbosstoolstarget-4.22.2.Final-SNAPSHOT.zip[jbosstoolstarget-4.22.2.Final-SNAPSHOT.zip]

* latest Kepler TP: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/targetplatforms/jbosstoolstarget/4.30.5.Final/jbosstoolstarget-4.30.5.Final.zip[jbosstoolstarget-4.30.5.Final.zip]

Then unzip the zip:

----
unzip *.target.zip -d /path/to/jbosstools-target-platforms/jbosstools/multiple/target/jbosstools-multiple.target.repo/
----

OR, use Maven to build it

See link:#optional-build-parent-and-target-platform[(Optional) Build parent and target platform]


Use it as a Maven mirror
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once you get the target platform available locally, you can use it
instead of the remote sites to save time. For this, we can simply use
Tycho target-platform mirroring:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform/Authentication_and_Mirrors#Mirrors[http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform/Authentication_and_Mirrors#Mirrors]

As example, you can simply edit to your link:#maven-settings[~/.m2/settings.xml] the
definition of the repositories to mirror: (replace
/home/hudson/static_build_env/jbds/.... by a path where your local
repository actuaaly stands)

----
<!-- IMPORTANT: Sites in target platforms: must not have trailing slash! -->        
<settings>
  <mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <id>jbosstools-target-platform-4.30.5.Final</id>
      <mirrorOf>http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/targetplatforms/jbosstoolstarget/4.30.5.Final/REPO</mirrorOf>            
      <url>file:///path/to/jbosstools-target-platforms/jbosstools/multiple/target/jbosstools-multiple.target.repo/</url>            
      <layout>p2</layout>
      <mirrorOfLayouts>p2</mirrorOfLayouts>        
      </mirror>
  </mirrors>
</settings>
----


(Optional) Build parent and target platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This step is only useful if you are actually working on the parent or
the target platforms and want to test local changes. Otherwise, Maven
will simply retrieve parent and TP definitions from
*https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jboss/tools/[JBoss
Nexus]* to perform your build.

See link:#optional-build-parent-and-target-platform[(Optional) Build parent and target platform]

Sometimes, Maven can't find the upstream artifacts - parent pom, tycho
plugins, minimum (Juno SR0) or maximum (Juno SR1 or later) target
platforms. First try again with the "-U" maven option. Or maybe you want
to build them locally in order to see how Tycho builds them, or
contribute a fix. To work around resolution problems, just build
locally:

----
cd /tmp; git clone git clone git://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-maven-plugins.git
cd /tmp; git clone git clone git://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-build.git
cd jbosstools-maven-plugins/tycho-plugins; mvn install; cd -
cd jbosstools-build/parent;  mvn install; cd -
cd jbosstools-build/target-platforms; mvn install -Pjbosstools-minimum,jbosstools-maximum

Building Individual Components Locally Via Commandline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Build a component resolving to a recent aggregation build for other JBT dependencies (Recommended)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Pros:
** You build only your component
** You only need source for your component
** Speed to resolve deps is greater
** You get generally the latest build for you component

* Cons:
** Takes some time to resolve dependencies on other component
** Can sometimes be out of sync if no build occured recently for a
component you rely on and had some important change. More risk to get
out of sync than with the staging site.

Tracked by
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11516[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11516]

Example:

----
cd jbosstools-server
mvn verify -P unified.target -Pjbosstools-staging-aggregate
----


Build a component resolving to the latest CI builds for other JBT dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Pros:
** You build only your component
** You only need source for your component
** You get generally the latest build for you component

* Cons:
** Takes some time to resolve dependencies on other component
** Can sometimes be out of sync if no build occured recently for a
component you rely on and had some important change
** Speed to resolve deps is worse

This profile is the one use for CI builds on Hudson.

Example:

----
cd jbosstools-server
mvn verify -P unified.target -Pjbosstools-nightly-staging-composite
----


Building Everything In One Build Locally Via Commandline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*LINUX / MAC USERS*

----
cd jbosstools-build
mvn clean install -gs ~/.m2/settings.xml | tee build.all.log.txt
----

(tee is a program that pipes console output to BOTH console and a file
so you can watch the build AND keep a log.)

*WINDOWS USERS*

----
cd c:\trunk\jbosstools-build
mvn3 clean verify -gs file:///$\{user.home}/.m2/settings.xml
----

or

----
mvn3 clean verify -gs file:///$\{user.home}/.m2/settings.xml >
build.all.log.txt
----

Remember to adjust your link:#maven-settings[~/.m2/settings.xml] file to specify
where you have your local target platform mirror built (or where you
downloaded & unpacked a target platform zip. Windows users, if you don't
have a .m2 folder, see
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6081617/missing-maven-m2-folder[this
article].


Building Locally In Eclipse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-devdoc/blob/master/building/build_from_eclipse.md


Installation Testing - making sure your stuff can be installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each component, when built, produces a update site zip and an unpacked
update site which can be used to install your freshly-built features and
plugins into a running Eclipse or JBDS instance.

Simply point your Eclipse at that folder or zip, eg.,
`jar:file:/home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools-server/site/target/server.site-*.zip!`
or
`file:///home/rob/code/jbtools/jbosstools-server/site/target/repository/`,
and browse the site. If your component requires other upstream
components to install, eg., jbosstools-server depends on
jbosstools-base, you will also need to provide a URL from which Eclipse
can resolve these missing dependencies. In order of freshness, you can
use:

1. http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/[http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/trunk/]
(Nightly Trunk Site - updated every few hours or at least daily -
*bleeding edge*)

2. http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/[http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/builds/staging/_composite_/core/trunk/]
(Composite Staging Site - updated every time a component respins -
*bleedinger edge*)

3. http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/[http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk/build/aggregate/local-site/]
(see the README.txt for how to use this site to refer to things you
built locally - *bleedingest edge*)


Adding a new feature or plugin to an existing component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tips and tricks for making BOTH PDE UI and headless Maven builds happy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's fairly common to have plugins compiling in eclipse while tycho
would not work. Basically you could say that tycho is far more picky
compared to Eclipse PDE.


Check your build.properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check build.properties in your plugin. If it has warnings in Eclipse,
you'll most likely end with tycho failing to compile your sources.
You'll have to make sure that you correct all warnings.

Especially check your build.properties to have entries for *source..*
and *output..*-- these are needed to
*http://wiki.eclipse.org/Minerva#Source[generate source plugins and
features]*.

----
source.. = src/
output.. = bin/
src.includes = *
src.excludes = src
bin.includes = your own,files to include,in the jar
----


Check your manifest.mf dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new issue when building against juno shows that all compilation
dependencies MUST be EXPLICITLY mentioned in your manifest.mf list of
dependencies. A recent example of how this can cause compilation errors
is the archives module, which failed to build due to the
org.eclipse.ui.views plugin, and its IPropertySheetPage interface, not
being found during the build. After investigation, it was discovered
that the archives.ui plugin did not explicitly declare a dependency on
org.eclipse.ui.views.

Inside eclipse and during Juno-based builds, however, the depencency was
found and there were no compilation errors. This was because a plugin
archives.ui explicitly dependend on (org.eclipse.ui.ide) had an explicit
dependency on org.eclipse.ui.views. The IDE was able to see that
archives.ui dependended on org.eclipse.ui.ide, and org.eclipse.ui.ide
depended on org.eclipse.ui.views.

Resolving nested dependencies no longer seems to be guaranteed, and so
anything you have a compilation dependency on must now be explicitly
declared in your manifest.mf
