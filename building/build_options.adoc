# Options for building JBoss Tools

## Maven options

Here are the options we recommend to learn (& use as needed) when running JBoss Tools builds:

* `-e` or `--errors` if the build should fail, produce execution error messages (stack trace) to help determine what happened.

* `-fae` or `--fail-at-end` continues the build until the end even when an error is detected. It allows for having more feedback at once: you get feedback for your whole build instead of only the parts that were built before the failure.

* `-fn` or `--fail-never` continues the build and reports errors, but does not return a failure code. This is useful if you want your build to successfully log errors, rather than failing if errors occur. 

* `-q` or `--quiet` produces quiet output - only shows errors.

* `-X` or `--debug` produces execution debug output; you should DEFINITELY log to a file if using this option.

* `-l` or `--log-file some-log-file.txt` defines the log file into which all build output will go. Can also pipe output through `tee` if you want to see output in console AND save to a file, eg., `mvn verify -X | tee some-log-file.txt`

* `-o` or `--offline` will work offline.

* `-U` or `--update-snapshots` forces a check for updated releases and snapshots on remote repositories.

## JBoss Tools profiles

The profiles listed below give you control of the dependency resolution.

### Target Platform

These profiles and properties control which versions of 3rd-party dependencies to use (eg., from Eclipse), by selecting which target platform to use.

* `-P maximum` will use the highest version of dependency JBoss Tools must be compatible with. These versions will be the one provided along with JBoss Developer Studio RCP application.
* `-Dtpc.version=...` allows you to select a specific version for the target platform for this build. This can be used to test older targets than the minimal one, or some experimental target platforms.

* `-P unified.target` (Default) will resolve all dependencies from a single *unified* site on download.jboss.org. This site does not contain sources. Its performance are better than using _multiple.target_.

* `-P multiple.target` will use a target platform which references *multiple* sites. This is mainly used if trying to build with a custom target platform that does not yet have a published `unified.target` in Nexus. Useful when doing pull requests to link:target_platforms/target_platforms_updates.adoc[update a target platform].

* `-Dno-target-platform=true` will disable target-platform resolution

[Note]
====
Trying to build a target platform locally and want it to *include sources*? See link:target_platforms/target_platforms_for_consumers.adoc[Using Target Platforms].

## Mojo options

Each mojo can have some options. You can list them with `mvn help:describe groupId:artifactId:version:mojo`. This will give details about the mojo, and you'll notice the _expression_ on some paramters. _expression_ tells you the system property that can be used to set the value.
If the mojo parameter was configured directly in pom.xml, then setting the _expression_ for this parameter will be ignore.

Here is the most useful mojo list

### Surefire

* `-Dmaven.test.skip=true` disable compilation and execution of test bundles

* `-DskipTests=true` disable test execution (not compilation)

* `-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true` and `-Dmaven.test.error.ignore=true` will not take into account test results the test results to decide whether build is successful or not. It can be used on Continuous Integration to let Jenkins decide on the result of the build: BLUE (everything OK), RED (Build Failed), YELLOW (some tests failed)

* `-DdebugPort=8000` will enable debugging during test activation on port 8000. Then you can use Eclipse Remote Java debugging to debug your tests while they're run from surefire

### Tycho

* `-Dtycho.localArtifacts=ignore` will prevent Tycho from reusing bundle artifacts built and installed locally. It ensures you'll use dependencies from upstream sites to build your component
