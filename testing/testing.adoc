= Testing

== On existing RCP application

With Tycho 0.19.0, we could fix the long-standing issue https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-13869[JBIDE-13869] (see https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-build/commit/74b4acbeaeacaf4edd657bed6164da468fb39ca3[change in parent pom]). This will allow you to run your test with Maven against an RCP application which is available in your filesystem.
You can do it by simply running for example:

[sources,bash]
----
cd tests/my.test.bundle
mvn clean verify -Dtest.profileName=epp.package.jee -Dtest.installPath=/home/me/eclipse-4.4.M2
----

If +test.installPath+ is not set, you get the default surefire behaviour which is to generate a simple minimal installation to run the tests in +target/work+.
More info about the profileName can be found in http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Testing_with_Surefire#p2Installed_on_provisioned_RCP_application . This works on any RCP application that relies on p2 (it's for example possible to run JBoss Tools inside Websphere Studio ;).

It's configured it so that by default, it is JBDS-friendly and set the jbds profileName. So to test on JBDS, you can omit the profile name and simply use:
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean verify -Dtest.installPath=/home/me/jbdevstudio-8.0.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT/studio
----

Except a few exceptions, other surefire parameters, such as the very cool +debugPort+ parameter, can be used together with this mechanism. 

== Integration or other slow running tests

Some components has a need for tests that test more than just basic unit test. For example tests that need to download additional runtimes to
do integration testing or have large number of test-combinations or simply tests that do testing via UI operations and thus tend to be slower than low level tests.

First of - the *best* thing to do is to do what one can to avoid the tests being slow to run in the first place. Test smart, have good testable API's,
use mocks etc. is generally better than having to rely on really heavy test runs. 

If that is not feasible then the following structure/layout is recommended.

In addition to a `tests` folder you createa `itests` folder (*i*tests as in "integration tests") and this folder follows the same layout
as the `tests` folder containing test bundles with the slight difference that their bundle and package name are now `itests` instead of just `tests`.

Thus before you would have the following in your component root:

```
pom.xml
plugins/
tests/
features/
site/
```

you will now have:

```
pom.xml
plugins/
tests/
itests/
features/
site/
```

=== Setup 

Within the `itests` folder there are a few minor differences that unfortunately cannot be shared in a parent pom thus it will have to be repeated for each component.

==== pom.xml and all-tests/pom.xml

You need to make sure `itests` are included into the various maven reactor poms that already includes `tests`.

This is done by simply adding the following line:

```
  <module>itests</module>
```

into the existing `<modules>` section just after the `tests` module.

In a default setup you should then have something like:

```
...
<project>
 <modules>
  <module>plugins</module>
  <module>tests</module>
  <module>itests</module>
  <module>features</module>
  <module>site</module>
</project>
```

==== itests/pom.xml

You will need as a minimum to configure `tycho-surefire-plugin` to use `${skiptITests}` and `${surefire.itests.timeout}` properties
instead of the default ones.

```
<build>
...
 <plugins>
  <plugin>
   <groupId>org.eclipse.tycho</groupId>
   <artifactId>tycho-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
   <skip>${skipITests}</skip>
   <timeout>${surefire.itests.timeout}</timeout>
  </configuration> 
</plugin>
...
```

What this does is do allow you to skip integration tests by simply passing `-DskiptITests` into your build locally or on the CI server (i.e. jenkins).

== Usage

By default Maven runs all tests, but you can skip them by using `-DskipTests`.
The same rule is applied for our `itests` but it is now called `-DskipITests` instead.

Meaning:

`mvn clean verify` runs all tests.
`mvn clean verify -DskipTests` skips *all* tests (including integration tests)
`mvn clean verify -DskipITests` skips *only* itests

=== Custom configuration

If your `itests` need custom configuration (and your existing `tests` pom.xml probably already have some) this can now be put in the `itests/pom.xml` file instead.

== Background and Examples

The initial implementation of the above was done in https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-server/pull/304

Thus at time of writing `jbosstools-server` is the only repository that contains examples of this approach.
