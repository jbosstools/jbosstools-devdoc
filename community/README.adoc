== Community Acceptance Testing

JBoss Tools CAT is an effort to obtain feedback from the JBoss Tools and JBoss Developer Studio users that the features in early builds are working fine. This will help us asses the quality of the final release.

The goal of the JBoss Tools CAT is to get as much feedback on our Alpha, Beta and pre-GA builds as possible. We are looking for feedback on usability, stability, quality and performance for new features. Reports on any regression for any existing features that are already used is very important.

See http://tools.jboss.org/cat/

=== Additional community doc

Since JBoss Tools 4.2, we now have a collection of How To Guides.
